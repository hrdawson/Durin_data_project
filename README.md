This is the git repository for the [DURIN
project](https://betweenthefjords.w.uib.no/durin/). The goal of this
repo is to organize and streamline the data management in the project
and beyond.

## DATA MANAGEMENT

### Location of data, metadata and code

The overview of all the **datasets** is
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KlQwSkcPa09POOSV0B7i_Z5KWcKDyw_Xu7Jikc9voyA/edit?usp=sharing).

The raw and clean **datasets** from are stored and will be made
available after the end of the project on [OSF](https://osf.io/f4v9t/).
For now the data is only available to the project partners.

All R code for the cleaning the raw data is available on the [Durin
GitHub](https://github.com/Durin-project).

The data documentation, including a draft for the data paper is
available
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Mky4gZfCzHIZl82zQKX6nb2vRneZXDRVDAmp0a3gdA/edit?usp=sharing)
(only available for authors), and the **data dictionaries** are in this
below in this readme file.

### Naming conventions for the data and files

We use **snake_case style** for names and coding. Snake_case means that
we use lower case letters separated by an underscore, for example
*biomass_g*.

File and variable names should be *meaningful*. Do not use *my_data.csv*
or *var1*. For a full description of the main variables see table below.

We use some **redundancy** in variable names to avoid mistakes. BlockID
and plotID should contain the higher hierarchical levels. For example
blockID is a combination of siteID + block number: Lyg1, Lyg2. PlotID
contains siteID, block number and treatment: Lyg1_open, Lyg1_forest

### Organize data sets

Sort the dataset so that the important variable come first, preferable
use this order:

- Date/year
- siteID
- blockID
- plotID
- habitat
- treatment
- plantID
- leafID
- response_variable (diversity, biomass, flux)
- predictor_variables (temperature level, oceanity)
- other_variables (remark, data collector, weather)
